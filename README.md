# CorruptEncoder
Encode a string or a file and make it look like it was corrupted.

Given a string key, it generates a deterministic array with Unicode characters ranging from 32 to 255.
This repository is still being worked on and this algorithm will change shortly.

TODO:
- Decode logic: might need to change the encode one to match a specific character to a Unicode character from the deterministic array.
